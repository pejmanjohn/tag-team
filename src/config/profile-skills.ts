/**
 * Materialize a profile's stored skills into Flue `SkillReference`s for the
 * agent's `AgentRuntimeConfig.skills`. Two spike-proven guards are mandatory
 * (see docs/plans/2026-07-13-capabilities-and-execution-plan.md, Phase 1):
 *
 *  1. DEDUPE BY NAME before returning. Duplicate skill names are a downstream
 *     turn-killer — Flue's `assertUniqueNames` throws AFTER the agent factory
 *     returns, aborting the turn with zero provider calls, and it cannot be
 *     caught here. Last-writer-wins keeps a single entry per name.
 *  2. PER-ROW `try/catch`. An invalid name/description throws
 *     `SkillDefinitionValidationError` synchronously at the `defineSkill` call;
 *     skip that one row so a single bad skill never kills the whole turn. (The
 *     admin write path validates too; this is defense in depth against a row
 *     that reached the store by another path.)
 *
 * Only `enabled` skills are materialized.
